ROADMAP

* Ipsum Lorem class to generate larger amounts of text
* Some type of "Person" class that would automatically `use` all of the 
  Person subclasses and generate all fields related to one Person while taking into account
  other fields of the same person (if that makes sense)
* Data::Maker::Field::Company: to generate realistic, but not necessarily real, company
  names, based on multiple word lists
* Data::Maker::Field::Address::Street:  to generate realistic street names, based on multiple
  word lists
* Data::Maker::Field::PhoneNumber: to generate realistic phone numbers, preferably for multiple locales 
* Making it possible to override the rand() call used throughout Data::Maker with some other
  randomization routine.
* Using seeding to ensure that the same data can be generated again and again
