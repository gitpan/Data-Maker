Data::Maker - Simple, flexibile and extensible generation of realistic data

Data::Maker does not know why kind of data you need, but it will help you make lots of it.

And if you happen to need one of the various types of data that is available as predefined field types,
it can be made even easier.

The big difference between Data::Maker and modules you may have seen before is that Data::Maker 
is specifically designed to make it easy for you to generate realistic random data.

ROADMAP

* Some type of "Person" class that would automatically `use` all of the 
  Person subclasses and generate all fields related to one Person while taking into account
  other fields of the same person (if that makes sense)
* Data::Maker::Field::Company: to generate realistic, but not necessarily real, company
  names, based on multiple word lists
* Data::Maker::Field::Address::Street:  to generate realistic street names, based on multiple
  word lists
* Data::Maker::Field::PhoneNumber: to generate realistic phone numbers, preferably for multiple locales 
* Making it possible to override the rand() call used throughout Data::Maker with some other
  randomization routine.
