0.18 (04.03.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Slightly-modified the first example in the Maker.pm POD, to match the same example in Tutorial.pod (thanks to David N. Blank-Edelman for pointing out the discrepancy)

0.17 (03.14.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Added default delimiter of "\t", so that the delimited() method will return a tab-delimited record by default
  * Added more detailed documentation to Data::Maker::Field::Initials, to point out the two different 
    ways to use that class.
  * There was already a "formatted" attribute defined for any field, which is a code reference that is to be applied to the 
    value after it is generated but before it is returned.  But it was not being used in the code, so I fixed that.

0.16 (03.07.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Fixed an oversight in the benchmarking documentation (forgot to change the 100 to 200)
  * Modified the seeding code to make sure seeding never happens more than once
  * Added Data::Maker::Field::MultiSet
  * Added Data::Maker::Field::Initials

0.15 (03.07.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * This was a botched release.  I accidentally released a copy of trunk when my changes had been made to a feature branch

0.14 (02.06.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Brought back SSN field, which is a good demonstration of creating a Format subclass
  * Fixed some version numbers because I have not been paying enough attention to them lately

0.13 (02.06.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Improved performance by more than 100% by changing the dynamic field methods to use
    AUTOLOAD instead of using dynamic Moose attributes.  We'll see if there's a downside
    to this.  

0.12 (02.05.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Added some notes to the POD; one about performance and one acknowledging the 
    existence of another module called Data::Faker
  * Added reset() method to Data::Maker, which sets generated() to 0
  * Added `from_name` attribute to Data::Maker::Field::Person::Gender, mainly for benchmarking
    purposes so I could benchmark the Gender field by itself.  If provided, it will use that name
    instead of getting the name from the field referenced by `from_field`.
  * Tweaked the Maker.pm POD a little, adding a section on performance, including benchmark results.

0.11 (02.05.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Two modules required by only one Field class each were not declared in Makefile.PL.  
    I added them, though I need to consider making each Data::Maker::Field subclass
    that requires other CPAN modules having its own distribution and not being required for
    Data::Maker itself.
  * Added the Set and Lorem classes to the Data::Maker man page, because all classes are 
    listed there -- which I forgot.  I need a checklist! :)
  * Got rid of all signs of Data::Maker::Field::Person::SSN.  I still want to have it 
    as an example of how you can easily add your own Format subclass, but I obviously 
    something since that original idea and I have to give it fresh thought.
  * Added Data::Maker::Field::Person, which right now is nothing more than a way to 
    import all of the Person classes.
  * Added a `before` trigger to record_count to reset the `generated` to zero whenever
    `record_count` is changed.  This might come back to bite me, but the only time it really
    makes sense to change the `record_count` is when you want to start over.
  * Added the Data::Maker->random class method for when you just need a really simple random 
    pick.  I added this specifically for hierarchical data, so you can have a maker object called
    in between `next_record` calls of another maker object that creates a random number of child
    objects.  It made sense to use $maker2->record_count( Data::Maker->random ).

0.10 (02.04.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Added Data::Maker::Field::Set

0.09 (02.03.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Now requiring that a "code" attribute be sent to Data::Maker::Field::Code 
  * Removed erroneous import of MooseX::AttributeHelpers -- thanks to Andreas Koenig (RT #54237)
  * Removed lib/Maker.pm, which should have not been in the distribution.

0.08 (01.31.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * I keep forgetting to update $VERSION in the files when the version changes.  Just updated them

0.07 (01.31.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Added $VERSION to all *.pm files
  * Changed PROPERTIES to ATTRIBUTES in the POD for Data::Maker
  * Fixed the code in the SYNOPSIS to make more sense (and added another example)
  * Documented Data::Maker::Field::Code
  * Documented Data::Maker::Field

0.06 (01.31.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>
  * Accidentally released a version with no net changes... oops

0.05 (01.31.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>

  * Changed $VERSION in the code to match the actual version (forgot to do that in 0.04)
  * Modified the description in the POD
  * Documented the individual Data::Maker::Field subclasses a little in the main Data::Maker page
  * Removed some Data::Maker::Field subclasses that should never have been in the distribution
  * Attributed my employer, ICA, for its support of the Perl community

0.04 (01.31.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>

  * Cleaned up some documentation

0.03 (01.31.2010) - John Ingram <john@funnycow.com>

  * Added the "Changes" file (this file)
  * Added essential POD to the main Data::Maker package
